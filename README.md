# Deep Builder

### A no code tool for building neural networks in the web. With this tool you can build neural networks without writing a single line of code. Drag layers from the components pane and drop them on the middle of screen. Set layer properties and connect multiple layers together to create a valid neural network. You can also download it in JSON format. However to actually consume the model in your project you have to convert it to keras/tensorflow format. Use tensorflowjs-converter for that purpose. 

### This app uses React, React hooks for state management and Jest and Cypress for testing.

### This app has few bugs, but, if everything done correctly then it is pretty easy to use. If you are a developer then headover to integration tests to see the 'happy path'. 
### Feel free to contribute/suggest features/improvements in github issues.
